# I18N-2 — Add ES + FR and Prepare for AI-assisted Localization

## Goal
Add Spanish and French support and prepare the workflow for AI-assisted translation tooling.

## Scope
- Add `es` and `fr` translation files
- Ensure missing keys fallback to English
- Document translation workflow for future scaling

## Notes
- Evaluate Intlayer (or similar) once the app has significant string volume
- Manual review required for sensitive UI strings (intake statuses, warnings, errors)

## Acceptance Criteria
- App supports EN, PT-BR, ES, FR
- Fallback strategy works (missing keys do not crash)
- Translation workflow is documented in `docs/`
